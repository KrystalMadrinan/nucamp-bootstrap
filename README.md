# Tasks

## Task 1 - Setup About Us Page

- [] Create a new file in your Bootstrap course project folder and name it aboutus.html. Copy and paste the starter content.

- [] In the head element, add a link to the bootstrap.min.css, the Lobster font from Google, and the styles.css file. At the bottom of the body element, add links to the jquery, popper, and bootstrap JS files.

## Task 2 - Format Web Page Using Bootstrap Grid

- Add formatting to the web page using the Bootstrap grid's container, row, and column classes.
- Make sure that:
- [] The “About Us” title and the "Community Partners" section both stretch across the entire width of their row.
- [] The “Our Mission” part occupies only half the width of the row for small to extra large screens. 
- [] The "Our Mission" and "Community Partners" content are each inside two divs. For each, the outer div should have both the row and row-content classes applied.

## Task 3 - Bootstrap Responsive Classes

- [] In aboutus.html, apply the d-none and d-sm-block Bootstrap responsive classes to the p elements containing the descriptions of the community partners so that they are hidden on only extra small screens.
- Read the documentation on these classes here. See how the combination of classes shown here enables you to hide the content for XS screen sizes. 
- Also apply these two classes to the three p elements in the body of index.html.
- In index.html's footer, in the Links, also update the link to About to point to "aboutus.html" instead of "#". 
- Afterward, in a XS viewport, the Community Partners section of your aboutus.html page should look like this: see assignment page
